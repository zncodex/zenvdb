**ZenvDB** is a modern, lightweight tool designed to take the headache out of local database management. Forget about complex installers, services, and configuration files. With ZenvDB, you just pick your database, and we handle the rest.

### 🔄 Fully Automated Setup
Stop wasting time with manual installations.
1. Go to **Add Database**.
2. Select your engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
3. Pick a version.
4. **ZenvDB does the rest**: It downloads the binaries, unzips them, and configures the environment automatically.

## 🛠 How It Works

ZenvDB keeps your system clean by isolating database binaries and data.

### 📂 Smart Directory Structure
- **`engines/`**: The application downloads and extracts database binaries here. This keeps your global PATH clean.
- **`data/`**: All actual database data is stored here. This means you can delete or upgrade an engine version without losing your data.

### ⚙️ Dynamic Configuration (`engines.conf`)
We don't lock you into specific versions. ZenvDB reads available versions from a simple text file: `engines.conf`.

**Want a specific version of MySQL or PostgreSQL?**
Just edit `engines.conf` and add it!

```ini
# Format: engine-version=download_url
mysql-8.4.7=https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/MySQL-8.4/mysql-8.4.7-winx64.zip
postgresql-18.1=https://sbp.enterprisedb.com/getfile.jsp?fileid=1259825
mongodb-8.2.2=https://fastdl.mongodb.org/windows/mongodb-windows-x86_64-8.2.2.zip
```

The application parses this file at startup, giving you total control over what versions are available for download.
